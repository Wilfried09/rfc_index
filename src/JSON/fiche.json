The connection topology is limited to a single point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers, but many carriers can be used without significant interference with each other, outside of early spring. This is because of the 3D ether space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3. The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance system, which increases availability. Unlike some network technologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to line-of-sight distance. Connection oriented service is available in some cities, usually based upon a central hub topology."

One major benefit to using Avian Carriers is that this is the only networking technology that earns frequent flyer miles, plus the Concorde and First classes of service earn 50% bonus miles per packet. Ostriches are an alternate carrier that have much greater bulk transfer capability but provide slower delivery, and require the use of bridges between domains. The service level is indicated on a per-carrier basis by bar-code markings on the wing. One implementation strategy is for a bar-code reader to scan each carrier as it enters the router and then enqueue it in the proper queue, gated to prevent exit until the proper time. The carriers may sleep while enqueued. For secure networks, carriers may have classes Prime or Choice. Prime carriers are self-keying when using public key encryption. Some distributors have been known to falsely classify Choice carriers as Prime. Packets MAY be marked for deletion using RED paint while enqueued. Weighted fair queueing (WFQ) MAY be implemented using scales, as shown: [Drawing] Carriers in the queue too long may leave log entries, as shown on the scale. The following is a plot of traffic shaping, from coop-erative host sites. [Another Drawing] Avian carriers normally bypass bridges and tunnels but will seek out worm hole tunnels. When carrying web traffic, the carriers may digest the spiders, leaving behind a more compact representation. The carriers may be confused by mirrors. Round-robin queueing is not recommended. Robins make for well-tuned networks but do not support the necessary auto-homing feature. A BOF was held at the last IETF but only Avian Carriers were allowed entry, so we don't know the results other than we're sure they think MPLS is great. Our attempts at attaching labels to the carriers have been met with resistance. NATs are not recommended either -- as with many protocols, modifying the brain-embedded IP addresses is difficult, plus Avian Carriers MAY eat the NATs. Encapsulation may be done with saran wrappers. Unintentional encapsulation in hawks has been known to occur, with decapsulation being messy and the packets mangled. Loose source routes are a viable evolutionary alternative enhanced standards-based MSWindows-compliant technology, but strict source routes MUST NOT be used, as they are a choke-point. The ITU has offered the IETF formal alignment with its corresponding technology, Penguins, but that won't fly. Multicasting is supported, but requires the implementation of a clone device. Carriers may be lost if they are based on a tree as it is being pruned. The carriers propagate via an inheritance tree. The carriers have an average TTL of 15 years, so their use in expanding ring searches is limited. Additional quality of service discussion can be found in a Michelin's guide."

This document offers such a specification."},

            {
              "title2": "3. Detailed Specification",
              "paragraphe": "Unless otherwise stated, the provisions of [RFC1149] and [RFC2460] apply throughout. <h3>3.1. Maximum Transmission Unit</h3> As noted in RFC 1149, the MTU is variable, and generally increases with increased carrier age. Since the minimum link MTU allowed by RFC 2460 is 1280 octets, this means that older carriers MUST be used for IPv6. RFC 1149 does not provide exact conversion factors between age and milligrams, or between milligrams and octets. These conversion factors are implementation dependent, but as an illustrative example, we assume that the 256 milligram MTU suggested in RFC 1149 corresponds to an MTU of 576 octets. In that case, the typical MTU for the present specification will be at least 256*1280/576, which is approximately 569 milligrams. Again as an illustrative example, this is likely to require a carrier age of at least 365 days. Furthermore, the MTU issues are non-linear with carrier age. That is, a young carrier can only carry small payloads, an adult carrier can carry jumbograms [RFC2675], and an elderly carrier can again carry only smaller payloads. There is also an effect on transit time depending on carrier age, affecting bandwidth-delay product and hence the performance of TCP. <h3>3.2. Frame Format</h3> RFC 1149 does not specify the use of any link layer tag such as an Ethertype or, worse, an OSI Link Layer or SNAP header [RFC1042]. Indeed, header snaps are known to worsen the quality of service provided by RFC 1149 carriers. In the interests of efficiency and to avoid excessive energy consumption while packets are in flight through the network, no such link layer tag is required for IPv6 packets either. The frame format is therefore a pure IPv6 packet as defined in [RFC2460], encoded and decoded as defined in [RFC1149]. One important consequence of this is that in a dual-stack deployment [RFC4213], the receiver MUST inspect the IP protocol version number in the first four bits of every packet, as the only means to demultiplex a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 packets. <h3>3.3. Address Configuration</h3> The lack of any form of link layer protocol means that link-local addresses cannot be formed, as there is no way to address anything except the other end of the link. Similarly, there is no method to map an IPv6 unicast address to a link layer address, since there is no link layer address in the first place. IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] is therefore impossible. Implementations SHOULD NOT even try to use stateless address auto- configuration [RFC4862]. This recommendation is because this mechanism requires a stable interface identifier formed in a way compatible with [RFC4291]. Unfortunately the transmission elements specified by RFC 1149 are not generally stable enough for this and may become highly unstable in the presence of a cross-wind. In most deployments, either the end points of the link remain unnumbered, or a /127 prefix and static addresses MAY be assigned. See [IPv6-PREFIXLEN] for further discussion. <h3>3.4. Multicast</h3> RFC 1149 does not specify a multicast address mapping. It has been reported that attempts to implement IPv4 multicast delivery have resulted in excessive noise in transmission elements, with subsequent drops of packet digests. At the present time, an IPv6 multicast mapping has not been specified, to avoid such problems."

            {
              "title2": "4. Quality-of-Service Considerations",
              "paragraphe": "[RFC2549] is also applicable in the IPv6 case. However, the author of RFC 2549 did not take account of the availability of the Differentiated Services model [RFC2474]. IPv6 packets carrying a non-default Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value in their Traffic Class field [RFC2460] MUST be specially encoded using green or blue ink such that the DSCP is externally visible. Note that red ink MUST NOT be used to avoid confusion with the usage of red paint specified in RFC 2549. RFC 2549 did not consider the impact on quality of service of different types of carriers. There is a broad range. Some are very fast but can only carry small payloads and transit short distances, others are slower but carry large payloads and transit very large distances. It may be appropriate to select the individual carrier for a packet on the basis of its DSCP value. Indeed, different carriers will implement different per-hop behaviors according to RFC 2474."

              "paragraphe": "Routing carriers through the territory of similar carriers, without peering agreements, will sometimes cause abrupt route changes, looping packets, and out-of-order delivery. Similarly, routing carriers through the territory of predatory carriers may potentially cause severe packet loss. It is strongly recommended that these factors be considered in the routing algorithm used to create carrier routing tables. Implementers should consider policy-based routing to ensure reliable packet delivery by routing around areas where territorial and predatory carriers are prevalent. There is evidence that some carriers have a propensity to eat other carriers and then carry the eaten payloads. Perhaps this provides a new way to tunnel an IPv4 packet in an IPv6 payload, or vice versa. However, the decapsulation mechanism is unclear at the time of this writing."

This appears to be a fundamental restriction on the topologies in which both RFC 1149 and the present specification can be deployed."

In addition, recent experience suggests that the transmission elements are exposed to many different forms of denial-of-service attacks, especially when perching. Also, the absence of link layer identifiers referred to above, combined with the lack of checksums in the IPv6 header, basically means that any transmission element could be mistaken for any other, with no means of detecting the substitution at the network layer. The use of an upper-layer security mechanism of some kind seems like a really good idea. There is a known risk of infection by the so-called H5N1 virus. Appropriate detection and quarantine measures MUST be available."
