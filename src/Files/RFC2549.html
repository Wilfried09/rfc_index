				<h1>IP over Avian Carriers with Quality of Service</h1>
				<section>
					<h2>Status of this Memo</h2>

					<p>This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
					community.  It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
					Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.
					Distribution of this memo is unlimited.</p>

					<h2>Abstract</h2>

					<p>This memo amends RFC 1149, "A Standard for the Transmission of IP
					Datagrams on Avian Carriers", with Quality of Service information.
					This is an experimental, not recommended standard.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Overview and Rational</h2>

					<p>The following quality of service levels are available: Concorde,
					First, Business, and Coach.  Concorde class offers expedited data
					delivery.  One major benefit to using Avian Carriers is that this is
					the only networking technology that earns frequent flyer miles, plus
					the Concorde and First classes of service earn 50% bonus miles per
					packet.  Ostriches are an alternate carrier that have much greater
					bulk transfer capability but provide slower delivery, and require the
					use of bridges between domains.

					The service level is indicated on a per-carrier basis by bar-code
					markings on the wing.  One implementation strategy is for a bar-code
					reader to scan each carrier as it enters the router and then enqueue
					it in the proper queue, gated to prevent exit until the proper time.
					The carriers may sleep while enqueued.

					For secure networks, carriers may have classes Prime or Choice.
					Prime carriers are self-keying when using public key encryption.
					Some distributors have been known to falsely classify Choice carriers
					as Prime.

					Packets MAY be marked for deletion using RED paint while enqueued.

					Weighted fair queueing (WFQ) MAY be implemented using scales, as
					shown:</p>
					<pre>
			                ____
				  _____/-----\   / o\
				<  ___   _____\_/    >--
 +-----+           	  \ /    /______/
 | 10g |               /|:||/
 +-----+              /____/|
 | 10g |                    |
 +-----+          ..        X
 ===============================

					<p>
					Carriers in the queue too long may leave log entries, as shown on the
					scale.

					The following is a plot of traffic shaping, from coop-erative host
					sites.</p>

					<p>
					Avian carriers normally bypass bridges and tunnels but will seek out
					worm hole tunnels.  When carrying web traffic, the carriers may
					digest the spiders, leaving behind a more compact representation.
					The carriers may be confused by mirrors.

					Round-robin queueing is not recommended.  Robins make for well-tuned
					networks but do not support the necessary auto-homing feature.

					A BOF was held at the last IETF but only Avian Carriers were allowed
					entry, so we don't know the results other than we're sure they think
					MPLS is great.  Our attempts at attaching labels to the carriers have
					been met with resistance.

					NATs are not recommended either -- as with many protocols, modifying
					the brain-embedded IP addresses is difficult, plus Avian Carriers MAY
					eat the NATs.

					Encapsulation may be done with saran wrappers.  Unintentional
					encapsulation in hawks has been known to occur, with decapsulation
					being messy and the packets mangled.

					Loose source routes are a viable evolutionary alternative enhanced
					standards-based MSWindows-compliant technology, but strict source
					routes MUST NOT be used, as they are a choke-point.

					The ITU has offered the IETF formal alignment with its corresponding
					technology, Penguins, but that won't fly.

					Multicasting is supported, but requires the implementation of a clone
					device.  Carriers may be lost if they are based on a tree as it is
					being pruned.  The carriers propagate via an inheritance tree.  The
					carriers have an average TTL of 15 years, so their use in expanding
					ring searches is limited.

					Additional quality of service discussion can be found in a Michelin's
					guide.</p>

					<h2>Specification of Requirements</h2>

					<p>In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
					of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.

					MUST      Usually.

					MUST NOT  Usually not.

					SHOULD    Only when Marketing insists.

					MAY       Only if it doesn't cost extra.</p>

					<h2>Security Considerations</h2>

					<p>There are privacy issues with stool pigeons.

					Agoraphobic carriers are very insecure in operation.</p>

					<h2>Patent Considerations</h2>

					<p>There is ongoing litigation about which is the prior art: carrier or egg.</p>
