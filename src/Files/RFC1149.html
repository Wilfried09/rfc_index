				<h1>A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers</h1>
				<section>
					<h2>Status of this Memo</h2>

					<p>This memo describes an experimental method for the encapsulation of
					IP datagrams in avian carriers.  This specification is primarily
					useful in Metropolitan Area Networks.  This is an experimental, not
					recommended standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Overview and Rational</h2>

					<p>Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low
					altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single
					point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers,
					but many carriers can be used without significant interference with
					each other, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether
					space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by
					IEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance
					system, which increases availability.  Unlike some network
					technologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to
					line-of-sight distance.  Connection oriented service is available in
					some cities, usually based upon a central hub topology.</p>

					<h2>Frame Format</h2>

					<p>The IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll of paper, in
					hexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.
					The scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier.
					A band of duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  The
					bandwidth is limited to the leg length.  The MTU is variable, and
					paradoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age.  A
					typical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram padding may be needed.

					Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the
					datagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable
					form.</p>

					<h2>Discussion</h2>

					<p>Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized pecking
					order.  An additional property is built-in worm detection and
					eradication.  Because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss
					of a carrier can be tolerated.  With time, the carriers are self-regenerating.
					While broadcasting is not specified, storms can causedata loss.
					There is persistent delivery retry, until the carrierdrops.
					Audit trails are automatically generated, and can often befound on logs and cable trays.</p>

					<h2>Security Considerations</h2>

					<p>Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special
					measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers
					are used in a tactical environment.</p>
